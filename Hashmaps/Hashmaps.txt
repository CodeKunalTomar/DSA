unordered_map has time complexity of O(1).
ordered_map i.e. map has time complexity of O(nlogn) and uses balanced BST.

Iterators are used to access elements of a map(ordered and unoredered).

Difference b/w set and map:-

-> set stores only keys but map can stor both keys and value.

Hash function gives us the random number(index) of a key, and at that index we will store the key in a bucket array(an array where we store the key)

Hash function consists of two types:- -> Hash Code -> Compression Function
