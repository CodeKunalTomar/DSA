There are two types of Priority Queues -
1) Min Priority Queue(whose priority is minimum
2) Max Priority Queue(whose priority is maximum

For Priority Queue we have introduced new data structure which is known as Heaps.

The time complexity of Priority Queue using Heaps will be O(h) i.e. O(log n) in both worst case and best case scenarios.

Min Priority and Max Priority Queue act as sorting elements in increasing and decreasing order which is known as Heap Sort.

We use Inplace keyword for algorithms whose space complexity is O(1).
